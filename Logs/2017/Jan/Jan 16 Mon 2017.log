[Fri Jan 20 01:38:28 2017]  say: ^0З^7reeD: which is odd since this is a makermod server
[Fri Jan 20 01:38:36 2017]  say: ^0З^7reeD: btw makermod is similar to lugormod in that you can build

[Fri Jan 20 01:40:34 2017]  say: Padawan: The only thing missing is a few remaps on some objects
[Fri Jan 20 01:40:39 2017]  say: Padawan: So that it fits together better
[Fri Jan 20 01:40:52 2017]  say: Padawan: Yea it's possible in lugormod for sure
[Fri Jan 20 01:41:05 2017]  say: Padawan: This is a well done throne.
