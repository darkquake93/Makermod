[Wed Sep 25 13:25:06 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: NEVER have that many npc limits
[Wed Sep 25 13:25:17 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: i could crash your server with just 12 npcs
[Wed Sep 25 13:25:20 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: anyone can do it
[Wed Sep 25 13:25:34 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: its best to set an overall 30- npc limit
[Wed Sep 25 13:25:50 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: oh ok thx
[Wed Sep 25 13:25:56 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: I thought it was just the max allowed

[Wed Sep 25 13:27:05 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: I'll put it back to there
[Wed Sep 25 13:27:26 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: Dark, i knew a server once, where someone came in and spammed enough npcs with the 100 npc limit
[Wed Sep 25 13:27:38 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: enough that it cause permanent file corruption in the guy's server files
[Wed Sep 25 13:27:40 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: dont.
[Wed Sep 25 13:27:49 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: oh well strange it's the default
[Wed Sep 25 13:27:51 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: 30 then
[Wed Sep 25 13:27:59 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: I just don't want clients to run out of npcs

[Wed Sep 25 13:28:10 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: that is the least of your worries, dark.
[Wed Sep 25 13:28:13 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: so that's like 10 npc per client if there's 3
[Wed Sep 25 13:28:17 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: mhm
[Wed Sep 25 13:28:21 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: alright fair enough

[Wed Sep 25 13:30:54 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: /mplace hoth/bed
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:12 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: then /mdrop and a bunch of other commands to modify it
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:25 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: like mplatform, mscale, etc.
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:32 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: yeah I just cracked mplatform
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:39 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: we wanted a door but it didn't help much :p
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:39 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: ''cracked''?
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:43 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: yeah figured it out
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:46 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: ah
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:46 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: it's an expression
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:54 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: mplatform is extremely easy to learn
[Wed Sep 25 13:31:59 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: /mdoor is just buggy as shit.
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:03 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: yeah exactly
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:14 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: i'll tell you a protip about connecting a button to an /mplatform door:
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:21 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: place the button down, make it usable
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:30 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: place the ob thats the door down, NOT mplatform het
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:32 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: yet*
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:38 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: connect the switch to the immobile object
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:44 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: THEN make the door /mplatform
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:52 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: ahh right
[Wed Sep 25 13:32:54 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: it prevents the using of the door and not the switch
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:00 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: thx
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:03 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: I'll try that
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:05 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: or if its mtouchable,t he touching of the door
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:14 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: i once made an automatic door system xD
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:28 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: you'd walk near it, itd open, and would work on both sides lol
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:36 2013]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Ð^0us^7«: no buttons, just walking
[Wed Sep 25 13:33:36 2013]  say: ^0Darkquake is back!: awesome :p

[Wed Sep 25 23:07:52 2013]  say: V^0î^7§å^0g^7e^3: ^7you cant have the tripremap script execute because theres a maximum number of remaps.
[Wed Sep 25 23:08:03 2013]  say: V^0î^7§å^0g^7e^3: ^7as in you cant have it exec on this map because itll just remap nothing and be wasted.
[Wed Sep 25 23:08:10 2013]  say: V^0î^7§å^0g^7e^3: ^7and i wont be able to remap THIS map because the cap will be hit
[Wed Sep 25 23:08:14 2013]  say: V^0î^7§å^0g^7e^3: ^7so youll have to make seperate scripts for each map.
