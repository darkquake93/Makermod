[Mon May 16 00:20:35 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: XD
[Mon May 16 00:20:36 2016]  say: Padawan: command for offset again
[Mon May 16 00:20:44 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: uhm
[Mon May 16 00:20:44 2016]  say: Padawan: I havnt tried it yet
[Mon May 16 00:20:54 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: markoffset and marktoffset
[Mon May 16 00:20:59 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: you can find the makermodule commands with /help
[Mon May 16 00:21:09 2016]  say: Padawan: .they arent listed
[Mon May 16 00:21:12 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: O_o
[Mon May 16 00:21:14 2016]  say: Padawan: .maybe I have the old version
[Mon May 16 00:21:20 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: which version?
[Mon May 16 00:21:25 2016]  say: Padawan: .shrug.
[Mon May 16 00:21:27 2016]  say: Padawan: .ill check
[Mon May 16 00:22:06 2016]  say: Padawan: 0.4a
[Mon May 16 00:22:09 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: ah
[Mon May 16 00:22:18 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: Yeah. You can find makermodule 0.61a on my website :d
[Mon May 16 00:22:24 2016]  say: Padawan: jaysus ive been missing out.
[Mon May 16 00:22:26 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: lol

[Mon May 16 00:24:05 2016]  say: Padawan: ive never seen these features  before
[Mon May 16 00:24:08 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: :D
[Mon May 16 00:24:11 2016]  say: Padawan: thast probably whyi ve never used them
[Mon May 16 00:24:13 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: ah
[Mon May 16 00:25:14 2016]  say: Padawan: aay.
[Mon May 16 00:25:14 2016]  say: Padawan: cool
[Mon May 16 00:25:25 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: :D
[Mon May 16 00:25:25 2016]  say: Padawan: it doesnt look like its exactly...
[Mon May 16 00:25:31 2016]  say: Padawan: a 10:1 ratio
[Mon May 16 00:25:33 2016]  say: Padawan: for the offset
[Mon May 16 00:25:59 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: lmao
[Mon May 16 00:26:52 2016]  say: Padawan: how do i makermod.
[Mon May 16 00:26:53 2016]  say: Padawan: x.x
[Mon May 16 00:26:55 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: ?
[Mon May 16 00:26:59 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: whatcha trying to do?
[Mon May 16 00:27:10 2016]  say: Padawan: there
[Mon May 16 00:27:12 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: :D
[Mon May 16 00:27:29 2016]  say: Padawan: yeah.
[Mon May 16 00:27:32 2016]  say: Padawan: its not the same ratio.
[Mon May 16 00:27:36 2016]  say: Padawan: 128 is bigger than 12.8
[Mon May 16 00:27:38 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: roughly ;o
[Mon May 16 00:27:43 2016]  say: Padawan: thats a pain.
[Mon May 16 00:27:47 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: also
[Mon May 16 00:27:51 2016]  say: Padawan: why would they make it 0.95 or whatever.
[Mon May 16 00:27:58 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: catwalks aren't an exact square
[Mon May 16 00:28:05 2016]  say: Padawan: arent they?
[Mon May 16 00:28:08 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I don't think so
[Mon May 16 00:28:08 2016]  say: Padawan: mmkay
[Mon May 16 00:28:10 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: let me check
[Mon May 16 00:29:22 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: Z / height = 8
[Mon May 16 00:29:38 2016]  say: Padawan: ...
[Mon May 16 00:29:39 2016]  say: Padawan: anger.
[Mon May 16 00:29:41 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: Y = 128
[Mon May 16 00:29:48 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: X = 127.984
[Mon May 16 00:29:48 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: lol
[Mon May 16 00:29:53 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: so almost a square
[Mon May 16 00:30:09 2016]  say: Padawan: yeah i noticed.
[Mon May 16 00:30:12 2016]  say: Padawan: ccuz cu
[Mon May 16 00:30:15 2016]  say: Padawan: cuz in lugormod
[Mon May 16 00:30:22 2016]  say: Padawan: the things are multiplied by 10
[Mon May 16 00:30:26 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: mhm
[Mon May 16 00:30:32 2016]  say: Padawan: but if you look here
[Mon May 16 00:30:35 2016]  say: Padawan: theres a seam on this one
[Mon May 16 00:30:35 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: the map actually uses the *10 number
[Mon May 16 00:30:37 2016]  say: Padawan: but not this one
[Mon May 16 00:30:48 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: but for some reason, makermod uses divided by 10
[Mon May 16 00:30:48 2016]  say: Padawan: what a pain.
[Mon May 16 00:30:56 2016]  say: Padawan: hmm.
[Mon May 16 00:31:02 2016]  say: Padawan: how would I fix this i wonder.
[Mon May 16 00:31:06 2016]  say: Padawan: i guess i would just have to do the math.
[Mon May 16 00:31:09 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: yeah
[Mon May 16 00:31:22 2016]  say: Padawan: why would they do that.
[Mon May 16 00:31:24 2016]  say: Padawan: thats absurd.
[Mon May 16 00:31:27 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: laziness. lol
[Mon May 16 00:31:34 2016]  say: Padawan: how is it lazy to make something more complicated
[Mon May 16 00:31:47 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: you know how they did the 1st person mode weapons, right?
[Mon May 16 00:31:52 2016]  say: Padawan: moved the camera
[Mon May 16 00:31:55 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: no
[Mon May 16 00:31:58 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: well kinda but...
[Mon May 16 00:32:50 2016]  say: Padawan: they put the object infront of your camera?
[Mon May 16 00:32:51 2016]  say: Padawan: or something?
[Mon May 16 00:32:53 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: yeah
[Mon May 16 00:32:53 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: lol
[Mon May 16 00:33:02 2016]  say: Padawan: shrg
[Mon May 16 00:33:05 2016]  say: Padawan: so uh
[Mon May 16 00:33:11 2016]  say: Padawan: with those measurements in mind...
[Mon May 16 00:33:16 2016]  say: Padawan: if i wanted everything seamless
[Mon May 16 00:33:28 2016]  say: Padawan: would i do 0 127.6564564564564565
[Mon May 16 00:33:32 2016]  say: Padawan: or would i do 127.534543 0 0
[Mon May 16 00:33:44 2016]  say: Padawan: in practicality does it apply to the first or the second number
[Mon May 16 00:33:46 2016]  say: Padawan: is what im asking.
[Mon May 16 00:34:02 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: you'd do 12.753453 0 0
[Mon May 16 00:34:07 2016]  say: Padawan: using offset*
[Mon May 16 00:34:11 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: since mmove divides by 10
[Mon May 16 00:34:12 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: oh
[Mon May 16 00:34:26 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: uhh
[Mon May 16 00:34:36 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: idk if offset uses *10 or not. sec
[Mon May 16 00:34:41 2016]  say: Padawan: i mean.
[Mon May 16 00:34:47 2016]  say: Padawan: ill test.
[Mon May 16 00:34:50 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: kk
[Mon May 16 00:34:54 2016]  say: Padawan: a basic test that is.
[Mon May 16 00:35:16 2016]  say: Padawan: it does not.
[Mon May 16 00:35:23 2016]  say: Padawan: this gap is wider than this one
[Mon May 16 00:35:28 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: :<
[Mon May 16 00:35:31 2016]  say: Padawan: soooo
[Mon May 16 00:35:40 2016]  say: Padawan: i would have to account for that AND the fact that catwalks arent squares
[Mon May 16 00:35:47 2016]  say: Padawan: is there any way to find out what measurement it uses?
[Mon May 16 00:35:55 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: this is my scaled by 1 platform :o
[Mon May 16 00:36:14 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: tried to eliminate z-fighting. lol
[Mon May 16 00:36:18 2016]  say: Padawan: mhm
[Mon May 16 00:36:20 2016]  say: Padawan: /mmove 12.8
[Mon May 16 00:36:22 2016]  say: Padawan: 25.6
[Mon May 16 00:36:24 2016]  say: Padawan: 38.6
[Mon May 16 00:36:27 2016]  say: Padawan: 42.8
[Mon May 16 00:36:28 2016]  say: Padawan: 60
[Mon May 16 00:36:31 2016]  say: Padawan: good times.
[Mon May 16 00:36:32 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: Yeah
[Mon May 16 00:36:42 2016]  say: Padawan: >is there any way to find out what the ratio is for makermodule
[Mon May 16 00:36:45 2016]  say: Padawan: since its not by 10
[Mon May 16 00:36:54 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: uhm
[Mon May 16 00:36:57 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: ask didz, I guess
[Mon May 16 00:36:59 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: since he made it
[Mon May 16 00:37:07 2016]  say: Padawan: I wonder why he would choose to do that.
[Mon May 16 00:37:47 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: fgs. I thought i took that out xD
[Mon May 16 00:37:52 2016]  say: Padawan: eh?
[Mon May 16 00:37:55 2016]  say: Padawan: im playing muted
[Mon May 16 00:37:57 2016]  say: Padawan: so if you made a sound
[Mon May 16 00:37:58 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: Oh. lol
[Mon May 16 00:38:01 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: yeah
[Mon May 16 00:38:03 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I commented out the sound
[Mon May 16 00:38:09 2016]  say: Padawan: right
[Mon May 16 00:38:13 2016]  say: Padawan: meanwhile
[Mon May 16 00:38:15 2016]  say: Padawan: it looks like 12.8
[Mon May 16 00:38:18 2016]  say: Padawan: isnt a good measurement at all.
[Mon May 16 00:38:22 2016]  say: Padawan: my life is a lie.
[Mon May 16 00:39:10 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: just noticed *_*
[Mon May 16 00:39:15 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: my script called scaledby1.cfg
[Mon May 16 00:39:19 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: is actually scaled by 2
[Mon May 16 00:39:19 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: lol
[Mon May 16 00:39:25 2016]  say: Padawan: exactly.
[Mon May 16 00:39:27 2016]  say: Padawan: i was wondering about that.
[Mon May 16 00:39:31 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: XD
[Mon May 16 00:39:38 2016]  say: Padawan: ugh.
[Mon May 16 00:39:49 2016]  say: Padawan: his mmark is different from the normal mmark too
[Mon May 16 00:39:55 2016]  say: Padawan: mmarkdest 0 0 0
[Mon May 16 00:39:57 2016]  say: Padawan: is like
[Mon May 16 00:40:01 2016]  say: Padawan: -0.1 lower
[Mon May 16 00:40:03 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: <
[Mon May 16 00:40:04 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: :<
[Mon May 16 00:40:05 2016]  say: Padawan: than the normal mmark
[Mon May 16 00:40:25 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: well just don't rely on marktoffset :D it seems pretty inaccurate to me
[Mon May 16 00:40:28 2016]  say: Padawan: niet
[Mon May 16 00:40:30 2016]  say: Padawan: i love it.
[Mon May 16 00:40:32 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: oh
[Mon May 16 00:40:35 2016]  say: Padawan: i dont like the fookin
[Mon May 16 00:40:39 2016]  say: Padawan: uh
[Mon May 16 00:40:41 2016]  say: Padawan: actual movement
[Mon May 16 00:40:43 2016]  say: Padawan: of objects
[Mon May 16 00:40:53 2016]  say: Padawan: being able to place an effect or an object without having to wait for it to move there would have ben amazing back in the day
[Mon May 16 00:41:01 2016]  say: Padawan: we could make effect scripts that doesnt look weird
[Mon May 16 00:41:05 2016]  say: Padawan: cuz they had to move to their place
[Mon May 16 00:41:07 2016]  say: Padawan: and THEN do the thing
[Mon May 16 00:41:15 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: ah
[Mon May 16 00:41:22 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: well
[Mon May 16 00:41:37 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: proxymod had a command that was like mmove but also had a parameter for the time it took to get there
[Mon May 16 00:41:45 2016]  say: Padawan: good thing proxymod isnt a thing anymore
[Mon May 16 00:41:48 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: =3
[Mon May 16 00:41:49 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: why?
[Mon May 16 00:41:51 2016]  say: Padawan: isnt it?
[Mon May 16 00:41:53 2016]  say: Padawan: or do you have it?
[Mon May 16 00:42:02 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I have the serverside backed up. Yeah
[Mon May 16 00:42:12 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: but scooper has to give the owner permission to us eit
[Mon May 16 00:42:12 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: 3
[Mon May 16 00:42:12 2016]  say: Padawan: so in otherwords its not a thing on any existing server.
[Mon May 16 00:42:13 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: =3
[Mon May 16 00:42:15 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: no
[Mon May 16 00:42:25 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: why didn't you like it?
[Mon May 16 00:42:29 2016]  say: Padawan: i dont like spior
[Mon May 16 00:42:33 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: oh :o why?
[Mon May 16 00:42:39 2016]  say: Padawan: he didnt like me
[Mon May 16 00:42:41 2016]  say: Padawan: kappa

[Mon May 16 01:37:18 2016]  say: Sijumah: theres like 5 in that level.
[Mon May 16 01:37:22 2016]  say: Sijumah: even though the level is 2 seconds long
[Mon May 16 01:37:54 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: yeh haha. You should get Evolution mod if you still wanna play it, cause the guy changed the level to have all these troopers and stuff, and then you

[Mon May 16 01:38:20 2016]  say: Sijumah: work*
[Mon May 16 01:38:21 2016]  say: Sijumah: for the catwalk?
[Mon May 16 01:38:22 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: yeh it had troopers and you fought Yoda lol
[Mon May 16 01:38:22 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: oh
[Mon May 16 01:38:24 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I haven't checked
[Mon May 16 01:38:31 2016]  say: Sijumah: 10.25 is the size
[Mon May 16 01:38:32 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: -10.25 works
[Mon May 16 01:38:33 2016]  say: Sijumah: but it might not work 
[Mon May 16 01:38:39 2016]  say: Sijumah: 10.23 is biggest 10.25 is smallest
[Mon May 16 01:38:51 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: I found the right tweaking for repulse, one sec
[Mon May 16 01:38:52 2016]  say: Sijumah: and 10.24 had some strange properties
[Mon May 16 01:39:03 2016]  say: Sijumah: yeah
[Mon May 16 01:39:04 2016]  say: Sijumah: 10.25 works.
[Mon May 16 01:39:08 2016]  say: Sijumah: but i meant does it work to rise you up
[Mon May 16 01:39:10 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: try -10.239 :)
[Mon May 16 01:39:19 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: makes a really tiny catwalk, with a large hitbox
[Mon May 16 01:39:27 2016]  say: Sijumah: its better than 10.25
[Mon May 16 01:39:30 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: but there's a trick to all of these
[Mon May 16 01:39:38 2016]  say: Sijumah: or rather
[Mon May 16 01:39:39 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I use -10.23 for my final atonemnt
[Mon May 16 01:39:40 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: you gotta use mmove for it to register the hit box
[Mon May 16 01:39:45 2016]  say: Sijumah: the negative one
[Mon May 16 01:39:49 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: so use mmove 0 0 0 after you rescale it
[Mon May 16 01:39:56 2016]  say: Sijumah: the negative one you just said is bigger than 10.25***
[Mon May 16 01:39:58 2016]  say: Sijumah: thats what i meant to say.
[Mon May 16 01:39:59 2016]  say: Sijumah: x.x
[Mon May 16 01:40:06 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: look at the radius :)
[Mon May 16 01:40:16 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: -10.23 also gives it the hitbox of mscale 10
[Mon May 16 01:40:21 2016]  say: Sijumah: yeah
[Mon May 16 01:40:23 2016]  say: Sijumah: 10.25 is smaller.
[Mon May 16 01:40:30 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: but pain is small radius haha
[Mon May 16 01:40:35 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: lifts them though
[Mon May 16 01:40:54 2016]  say: Sijumah: i never knew that about -10.23
[Mon May 16 01:41:01 2016]  say: Sijumah: being the size of a 10 scaled one
[Mon May 16 01:41:02 2016]  say: Sijumah: err
[Mon May 16 01:41:03 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: -10.239
[Mon May 16 01:41:04 2016]  say: Sijumah: hitbox wise.
[Mon May 16 01:41:17 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: cause -10.24 starts making it bigger
[Mon May 16 01:41:19 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: iirc
[Mon May 16 01:41:21 2016]  say: Sijumah: shrug
[Mon May 16 01:41:25 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: it's all messed up
[Mon May 16 01:41:28 2016]  say: Sijumah: i like how this game has all the weird properties to it.
[Mon May 16 01:41:33 2016]  say: Sijumah: do you remember how to make someone a ghost?
[Mon May 16 01:41:38 2016]  say: ^0Ðàrk^2^1Qµàkè: yeah :D

[Mon May 16 01:58:42 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: oh
[Mon May 16 01:58:47 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: well thast just because makermods list isnt intact
[Mon May 16 01:58:54 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: theres lots of objects and effects that arent in mlist
[Mon May 16 01:58:57 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I checked the game's code. It's actually a sphere model with a shader
[Mon May 16 01:59:50 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: i seem to recall someone managing to place it
[Mon May 16 01:59:51 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: the model that is.
[Mon May 16 01:59:55 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: it may have been with a mod though
[Mon May 16 01:59:58 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: probably
[Mon May 16 02:00:04 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I checked the code and that's all there is
[Mon May 16 02:00:26 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: good luck selecting one of those
[Mon May 16 02:00:26 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: XD
[Mon May 16 02:00:32 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: i remember someone did it once.
[Mon May 16 02:00:35 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: :D
[Mon May 16 02:00:35 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: same thing for conc blast
[Mon May 16 02:00:47 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: what about one of these?
[Mon May 16 02:01:08 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: i remember someone selected the lazer
[Mon May 16 02:01:10 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: and the mine seperately
[Mon May 16 02:01:13 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: oh
[Mon May 16 02:01:13 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: so t hey moved the lazer
[Mon May 16 02:01:14 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: and like
[Mon May 16 02:01:16 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: uhm
[Mon May 16 02:01:16 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: lol
[Mon May 16 02:01:20 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: someone ran over it
[Mon May 16 02:01:23 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: 10 kilometers away
[Mon May 16 02:01:25 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: and it detonated the mine
[Mon May 16 02:01:27 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: far away from them
[Mon May 16 02:01:30 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: cuz the lazer was seperate
[Mon May 16 02:01:43 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: do you know the server command to allow voring?

[Mon May 16 02:01:53 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: Uhm... 
[Mon May 16 02:01:55 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: let me go get it
[Mon May 16 02:02:35 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: seta g_allowVote  0 
[Mon May 16 02:02:46 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: thanks fam
[Mon May 16 02:02:47 2016]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: I believe seta g_allowVote 8 only allows map voting
[Mon May 16 02:03:22 2016]  say: ^7§^0î^7j^0Ü^7må^0h^7~: fun.
