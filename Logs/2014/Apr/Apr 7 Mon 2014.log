[Mon Apr 07 21:05:27 2014]  say: Tusken King: Too bad no server presently--
[Mon Apr 07 21:05:27 2014]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Р^0us^7«: You should use some of your modeling experience to do such a thing.

[Mon Apr 07 21:06:19 2014]  say: Tusken King: can be a strange thing for me to handle on numerous factors.
[Mon Apr 07 21:06:23 2014]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Р^0us^7«: 'cept hamachi requires actual server configs and shit lol.
[Mon Apr 07 21:06:43 2014]  say: Tusken King: The idea there, is if i had my own server built.
[Mon Apr 07 21:06:48 2014]  say: Tusken King: I'd be able to house things i build.
[Mon Apr 07 21:06:53 2014]  say: Tusken King: Such as the tf2 npcs.

[Mon Apr 07 21:07:37 2014]  say: Tusken King: Could've sworn, unless we winded up bringing the wrong file.
[Mon Apr 07 21:07:43 2014]  say: Tusken King: One of the ones i did had some template write ups.
[Mon Apr 07 21:07:47 2014]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Р^0us^7«: Did you make it a .jkb file?
[Mon Apr 07 21:07:54 2014]  say: Tusken King: Hm. i'll check it's pk3.
[Mon Apr 07 21:07:54 2014]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Р^0us^7«: That's a bot file.
[Mon Apr 07 21:08:22 2014]  say: Tusken King: Yeah, the one i use has some.
[Mon Apr 07 21:08:38 2014]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Р^0us^7«: hmm, you gave me the wrong thing then.
[Mon Apr 07 21:08:42 2014]  say: Tusken King: Probably, shoot.
[Mon Apr 07 21:08:48 2014]  say: Tusken King: and i did wind up removing it out of dropbox again.
[Mon Apr 07 21:08:52 2014]  say: ^7»^0Exo^1Р^0us^7«: Cause the one you gave me never included a .jkb file.
[Mon Apr 07 21:09:05 2014]  say: Tusken King: Basically all i did for them, is copy pasted default bot ai's.
[Mon Apr 07 21:09:08 2014]  say: Tusken King: and edited it.
[Mon Apr 07 21:09:14 2014]  say: Tusken King: Such like.. let's see...

[Mon Apr 07 21:09:26 2014]  say: Tusken King: Probably a bit. they are literally face drawn.
[Mon Apr 07 21:09:42 2014]  say: Tusken King: Done in such a way, that the color shading is literally eyes for glass.
[Mon Apr 07 21:09:46 2014]  say: Tusken King: this way they dont look as wrong.

[Mon Apr 07 21:11:10 2014]  say: Tusken King: Due to the convience. the plastering worked out just fine.
[Mon Apr 07 21:11:21 2014]  say: Tusken King: Thing with the robot's model files, is that they have a sort of overall wrap.
[Mon Apr 07 21:11:25 2014]  say: Tusken King: like wrapping paper.
[Mon Apr 07 21:11:39 2014]  say: Tusken King: You'd have to facehug the texture in such a way, that it works out fine. xD
