[Tue Apr 22 22:47:14 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: very well done.
[Tue Apr 22 22:47:51 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: this is the type of thing I did before makermod died, and nobody came to build anymore
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:00 2014]  say: ^0Toguro: Hm, I see.
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:18 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: I have other ships, but they are too big to fit on this map
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:28 2014]  say: ^0Toguro: Hah.
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:34 2014]  say: Padawan: ye but there are not much people playing jka this time
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:50 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: true, jka hasn't been very active
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:50 2014]  say: Padawan: it's too old for now
[Tue Apr 22 22:48:52 2014]  say: Padawan: imo
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:03 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: I'm just waiting for JKG to make progress
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:05 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Hey Onysfx
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:13 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: with the source code released it can. Tried the beta, it's nice
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:16 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: and ya?
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:20 2014]  say: ^0Toguro: Jk2 is better than jka to me still though.
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:39 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: I've never quite been able to learn how to build a ship, can you teach me?
[Tue Apr 22 22:49:57 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: Well you know how to /mgrab build right?
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:01 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: like just build normally?
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:13 2014]  tell: ^0Sakyo to ^4Ony^5sfx: No
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:22 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: oh dear
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:30 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: well you must learn that
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:32 2014]  tell: ^0Sakyo to ^4Ony^5sfx: That's why i have asked you.
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:45 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: you can learn basic makermod commands using /minfo
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:48 2014]  tell: ^0Sakyo to ^4Ony^5sfx: I did it once a long time ago but don't remeber anything on how to do it.
[Tue Apr 22 22:50:54 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: but to build things
[Tue Apr 22 22:51:05 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: basically, you'll want to do /mlist
[Tue Apr 22 22:51:11 2014]  tell: ^0Sakyo to ^4Ony^5sfx: Okat
[Tue Apr 22 22:51:12 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: then find the folder you want
[Tue Apr 22 22:51:30 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: lets use factory. Then you type /mplace factory/catw2_b
[Tue Apr 22 22:51:37 2014]  tell: ^4Ony^5sfx to ^0Sakyo: try that.
[Tue Apr 22 22:51:59 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: now place it where you want it
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:03 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: How
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:04 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: then do /mdrop
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:17 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Hm
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:20 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Okay
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:29 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Thats pretty much all i wanted to know actuallu
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:33 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: now you may be wondering how I built this ship so quickly
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:33 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Actually
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:38 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Sure
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:45 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: basically, you can do mmove commands
[Tue Apr 22 22:52:49 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: try /mmove 12 0 0
[Tue Apr 22 22:53:11 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Wow cool
[Tue Apr 22 22:53:16 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so what I did for my ship is
[Tue Apr 22 22:53:25 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: I made a notepad file on my computer
[Tue Apr 22 22:53:30 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Alright
[Tue Apr 22 22:53:40 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: then I typed out the object in the notepad I want to place
[Tue Apr 22 22:53:53 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: then did a ; to separate the commmand, and did /mmove <x> <y> <z>
[Tue Apr 22 22:54:07 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so like, mplace factory/catw2_b;mscale 2;mmove 24 0 0
[Tue Apr 22 22:54:15 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: And I did a bunch of those lines
[Tue Apr 22 22:54:22 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: and it created this
[Tue Apr 22 22:54:44 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: then you save it as a cfg file in your gamedata/base folder or makermod folder
[Tue Apr 22 22:54:52 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: and then /exec <filename> and there ya go
[Tue Apr 22 22:54:55 2014]  say: Padawan: swag
[Tue Apr 22 22:55:05 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: simpler than it sounds
[Tue Apr 22 22:55:16 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Oh cool
[Tue Apr 22 22:55:38 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: How do people get the objects such as like ive seen chairs ect ect
[Tue Apr 22 22:55:45 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: oh well, with /mlist

[Tue Apr 22 23:01:57 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: haven't made a switch on this side yet
[Tue Apr 22 23:01:59 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: ill show ya
[Tue Apr 22 23:02:08 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: this blue switch
[Tue Apr 22 23:02:11 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: right here
[Tue Apr 22 23:02:22 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: blue one press it
[Tue Apr 22 23:02:30 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: aim up a bit
[Tue Apr 22 23:02:46 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: How do you make it?>
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:01 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: well basically the same way I built my ship, lots of /mmove commands on the objects
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:05 2014]  Kill: 2 2 39: Padawan killed Padawan by MOD_SUICIDE
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:12 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: What command is this is mean haha
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:14 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: but I had to make a separate script for connecting the switches and opening the doors
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:20 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: because of makermods limitations
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:30 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: So?
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:38 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so..?
[Tue Apr 22 23:03:45 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: How do i make the doorsxDD
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:01 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: oh well...some time to explain will need. I'll teach you how to make a simple one
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:23 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so basically
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:29 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: you place an object
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:33 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Mkm?
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:39 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: How do you turn them?
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:46 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: ill tell you in a min
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:50 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so then basically
[Tue Apr 22 23:04:57 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: you can make it /musable or /mtouchable
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:07 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: usable means you'll have to use it, touchable means you just have to touch it
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:12 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so lets make it usable
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:19 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: alrighty
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:25 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: then to actually make it move when you use it
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:29 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: you use /mplatform
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:45 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: first value is for how high it goes, second is for the time it takes
[Tue Apr 22 23:05:54 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: so...just /mplatform 120 should do
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:02 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: tada
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:09 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: if you do /mplatform -120
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:12 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: it will move down instead
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:28 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: thats how I did those doors
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:29 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Coolness
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:33 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: but I added another value
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:42 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: I think it was 60 or something after, so like /mplatform 120 60
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:47 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: to make it take longer to opne
[Tue Apr 22 23:06:50 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: to match the sound
[Tue Apr 22 23:07:08 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: you can find a list of all the commands I just told you
[Tue Apr 22 23:07:12 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: in /minfo
[Tue Apr 22 23:07:16 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: How do you get a differant kind of walls
[Tue Apr 22 23:07:19 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: /minfo <catagory>
[Tue Apr 22 23:07:35 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: oh those are factory/longpipe_new
[Tue Apr 22 23:07:47 2014]  say: Padawan: waite

[Tue Apr 22 23:08:16 2014]  say: ^0Sakyo: Okay so how do you turn them
[Tue Apr 22 23:08:22 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: oh that's the /mrotate command
[Tue Apr 22 23:08:31 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: /mrotate <x> <y> <z>
[Tue Apr 22 23:08:37 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: x turns it like this
[Tue Apr 22 23:08:41 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: /mrotate 90 0 0
[Tue Apr 22 23:08:48 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: if I change y
[Tue Apr 22 23:08:51 2014]  say: ^4Ony^5sfx: /mrotate 0 90 0

[Tue Apr 22 23:47:58 2014]  say: ^1M^7r ^1Ð^7innertime: so there was never really any reason to not be on it
