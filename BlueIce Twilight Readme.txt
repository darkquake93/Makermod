---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is night time on a vast snowy plain. The barely audible squeaks and shuffles of nocturnal creatures going about the nightly business of surviving are 
the only sounds breaking the heavy silence. On all sides the plain is surrounded by mountains, their icy peaks glowing hauntingly in the moons cold reflected
light. The plain is flat, and immaculately white, only the rare track of an animal disturbing the perfectly smooth surface. A perfectly clear sky hangs 
above the scene, an untold number of stars casting their pinpricks of light onto the planet, under the watchful eye of the ice blue moon.
However, despite the clear sky and near silence on the plain, the atmosphere is far from a serene one. The air is dense with apprehension. It is as if the 
entire planet has taken a deep inward breath, as if every mountain, creature and tree on it is waiting. And have been waiting a long time.
Suddenly a blue light appears above the mountains, moving ever more quickly towards the plain. It is immediately followed by another light, orange and 
heading on exactly the same path. They can already be heard, two engines of slightly different pitches, both whining and straining as the ships hurtling 
towards the planet try to outrace eachother. The nature of the race is not clear, until a bright red bolt comes flying past the first ship and into the 
ground, the first ship only just moving out of the way in time to avoid having one of its wings ripped away.

Inside the cockpit of the first ship is a man in a simple robe. Far from looking panicked by his pursuer, and the alarm sirens around him signalling the 
damage already done to the ship, he has his eyes closed and a look of absolute concentration and focus is upon his face. A bladeless hilt on his belt 
confirms the profession that his ability to dodge the laser bolts flying past suggests. The Jedi guides the ship close to the ground and speeds parallel to 
it, close enough that the movement of the air around his ship kicks up a spray of snow around it. The movements of the ship are precise and smooth as it 
evades each potentially lethal bolt. The mans eyes open briefly to assess the distance of the oncoming mountain range, and when he closes his eyes again 
there is a clear sense of urgency in his expression. he looks desperately as if he is trying to remember something, his eyelids now flickering as his eyes
move rapidly behind them.

The mountain range speeds ever closer, with neither ship slowing down. No through it is available, even for the most skilful Jedi pilot. It is a wall of ice
and stone waiting expectantly for its victims. The Jedi's ship adjusts direction slightly to point towards the base of the nearest mountain, and bears down,
only twitching off course ocassionally to allow each laser to fly past. Just before it flies into the mountain, inside the cockpit the Jedi's face breaks 
into a smile, eyes still shut, and as he turns the ship sharply upwards, for a brief second his expression changes to a grimace of extreme effort and 
concentration. In that moment, the pursuing ship fires a single bolt before veering wildly and slamming into the mountain, vaporised instantly. The Jedi 
moves to dodge the bolt just a second too late, the supreme effort taken to dominate the pursuers mind clearly having an effect on his reactions. The outer
half of his left wing is sheared off and falls away into the mountains. 

Struggling to maintain control of the ship, the Jedi scans the mountain range for a place to land. As the ships altitude starts dropping sharply, the Jedi 
spots a small gap in the mountains ahead. He has no choice but to aim for it and hope it contains a suitable crash landing site, and steers the ship towards
it, fighting to keep it on course. The struggling ship just manages to clear the last mountain peak before the break in the range, and as the pilot looks 
ahead of him his jaw drops. As he makes the final preparations for his crash landing, he finally understands the voices that drew him here. He closes his 
eyes as the ship hits the ground, and skids across the ice and snow into a tree. The last thing he sees from his cockpit before slipping into unconciousness
is figure upon a huge landing pad, robes billowing, sillouheted by the moon.

====================================
Afterword:
====================================

This map was created at the request of the Nomadic Jedi Order by our friend Szico VII. It has been a long project, well over a year in fact. We are proud 
to have our name associated with such a great map, and to have so many of our ideas and designs brought into such breathtaking reality. On behalf of our 
clan, I thank not only Szico, but everyone who helped with the making of this map, and testing its many hundreds of betas. We all genuinely hope you enjoy 
it, and have as much fun playing on the finished article as we have had on the betas over the last year! :D

May the force be with you.

Editors Notes:
====================================

As far as I know, there's no technical bugs with this map, only aesthetic ones. I tried very hard to keep framerate at a decent level
throughout the entire map, and I believe this has been achieved, even for the main outside section. Don't expect blistering framerates on outdated 
cards/processors mind. ;) I had great fun making this map, for the most part, and it even makes me laugh when I look at the shots of the original beta which
started back in 2004. This has not only been a project for myself, but for {NJO,} whom have been immensely helpful throughout it's construction. I'd also
like to offer a special thanks to by buddies over at www.gamingforums.com www.map-review.com and http://darthg.com. Without you guys I don't know where I'd 
be! Another thanks to all my Beta testers, and Mace for making the video!

There are quite a few hidden secrets in this map, in fact, as IfritZero pointed out to me, most of the map is hidden when you first start playing! So have
a look around, there's a whole 2 giant sections to unlock aside from the main central area, plus a hidden tournament room which involves activating 3 
switches in a certain order. 'X' Marks the spot(s) as they say :) Keep a lookout for the wine cellars, underground facility and trams ajoining to the road in
and out of the village. Once you've reached a new area for the first time, you can uncover teleporters which will quickly let you pass between areas. You
will also find that you will now spawn in these areas, due to the 'dynamic' spawning system. (Cheers for the method of this Lassev!) Keep an eye out for
breakable walls, ice, unlockable doors and switches if you want to find everything :) Tauntauns will respawn after 30seconds, and I made some of the snowmen
force-reactive. Once again, have fun!!!

I included source files in this map, because I basically thought,'What the hell, why not!' However I would appreciate, seeing as I've released the source 
materials out of good will - (Christmas spirit goes straight to my head lol), that people respect the guidelines below:
