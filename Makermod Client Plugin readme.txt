Installation
---------------
This plugin is only for windows clients.
If you have the old client plugin, you should find it in your makermod folder as "zz_Makermod Client 0.1beta.pk3" Please delete or otherwise remove this file.
Extract the files from Makermod Client 1.zip into your makermod folder.
Make sure you have no other modifications installed that provide a cgamex86.dll or a uix86.dll file. If you do, you have to remove them to use this plugin.

- The client will only function for windows users.
- You will not be able to use other plugins at the same time.
- It contains all necessary functions to work with the official makermod client plugin. (Please read below)
- You will be able to play normally on any server not supporting the extra features.

---------------
Other Makermod Client Plugin
---------------
The previous official Makermod client plugin will still function, 
but you will have to open "Makermod ClientPlugin v1.1beta(WIP).pk3" or older one, 
and remove the uix86.dll file from inside it.
